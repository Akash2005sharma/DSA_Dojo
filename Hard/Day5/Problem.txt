Virat, recently appointed as a brand ambassador for 'A' Corporation, was tasked with establishing connections among 'a' brands using 
'b' two-way direct links. These connections would enable the seamless transmission of money between any pair of brands.
Each direct link must connect two distinct brands, ensuring that each pair of brands has at most one direct link.

However, 'B' Corporation, a rival of 'A' Corporation, approached Virat with an offer he couldn't refuse.
They requested that Virat design the brand connections in such a way that if any brand indexed as v were to fail,
the money transmission between certain other brands would become impossible. In other words, the system would cease to be fully connected.

Assist Virat in configuring the brand connections to meet these requirements.
The first input line contains 3 space-separated integer numbers 'a', 'b', v (3 ≤ a ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ b ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ v ≤ n),
'a' — amount of brand, 'b' — amount of direct connections, v — index of the brand that fails and leads to the failure of the whole system.

output
If it is impossible to connect the brands in the required way, output -1. Otherwise output 'b' lines with 2 numbers each — description of all the direct connections in the system.
Each direct connection is described by two numbers — indexes of two brands, linked by this direct connection. The servers are numbered from 1.
If the answer is not unique, output any.
