Once upon a time, the denizens of Middle-earth, including humans, elves, dwarves, and various other beings
,united to reclaim their stolen treasures from the clutches of Smaug. Under the leadership of the formidable elf Timothy,
they embarked on the quest to overthrow the ruler of the Lonely Mountain.

The army of Middle-earth comprises several divisions, each representing a squad.
It is understood that if two creatures of the same race are in different squads, they contribute 'a' units to the army's total strength.
However, due to the challenges associated with leading a vast army, Timothy recognizes the need to streamline operations.
Thus, for an army consisting of l brigades, the total strength is diminished by (l−1)⋅x units. It's important to note that the army must contain at least one squad.

With m distinct races inhabiting Middle-earth, the number of creatures belonging to the i-th race is denoted as 'di'.
Our task is to aid the inhabitants of Middle-earth in determining the maximum achievable strength of their assembled army.

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer z (1≤z≤2⋅104) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, a ,and x (1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5 ,1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6,0 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) — the number of races and the constants a and x described above.
The second line of each test case contains m integers d1,d2,…,dn (1≤di≤2⋅105) — the number of creatures of each of the m races.
