Long ago, when Alexei was a schoolboy, he had a strong interest in the grammar of the fictional language called LexiScript.
During one of his lessons, Alexei became fascinated by the following question:
How many distinct continuous substrings exist in the given string t that start with "sbegin" and end with "send" (where "sbegin" and "send" can be the same)?
Two substrings are considered different if their contents are not identical, regardless of their positions.
Alexei found this question challenging and sought assistance in counting them. Let's help him out!

first line - string t;
second line - sbegin;
third line - send;
The length of each string doesn't exceed 2000 characters.
