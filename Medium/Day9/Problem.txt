Each element in the structure can be assigned one of exactly 'P' patterns.
Determine the count of distinct pattern assignments to the structure such that:

All elements along any path of length at most two have unique patterns.
To manage the potentially large result, output it modulo 10^9+7.

Two pattern assignments of the structure are considered different if there exists at least one element that has different patterns in both assignments.
A path in the structure is a sequence of connected elements, where the path length between two elements is defined as the total number of edges in the shortest path from one element to the other.

The first line of the input will contain two integers N and P, the number of element in the structure and the number of patterns available respectively.
The next (N−1) lines will describe the given structure. Each line contains two integers a and b meaning that there is an edge between element a and element b.
