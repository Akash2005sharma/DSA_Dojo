You are given all N−1 integers in the range [2,N]. In each step, you choose 2 distinct integers and if they share a common factor greater than 
1, you combine them into the same group. You keep doing it until no further merging is possible.

Belonging to a group is an equivalence relation. So if integers a and b are in the same group and integers b and 
c are in the same group, then integers a and c are also said to be in the same group.

Find the total number of groups formed in the end.

1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^5
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^7
