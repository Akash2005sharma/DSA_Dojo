The Ranger has come across a group of creatures, each with its initial size denoted by Li.These creatures have a peculiar habit of consuming one another, where a creature i can devour another creature j if Li is greater than or equal to Lj.Upon consuming another creature, its own size increases by 1. The Ranger's objective is to maximize the count of creatures with sizes equal to or exceeding certain specified values.
