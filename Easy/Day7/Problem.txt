Kristina had an array a of length n consisting of non-negative integers.

She built a new array b of length n−1,such that bi=max(ai,ai+1) (1≤i≤n−1).

For example, suppose Kristina had an array a = [3,0,4,0,5] of length 5.Then she did the following:

Calculated b1=max(a1,a2)=max(3,0)=3;
Calculated b2=max(a2,a3)=max(0,4)=4;
Calculated b3=max(a3,a4)=max(4,0)=4;
Calculated b4=max(a4,a5)=max(0,5)=5.
As a result, she got an array b = [3,4,4,5] of length 4.
You only know the array b. Find any matching array a that Kristina may have originally had.
