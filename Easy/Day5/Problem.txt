Once upon a time, in a land with n charming cities linked by m intricate flight connections, 
there was a traveler yearning to embark on an unforgettable journey. This traveler, let's call 
them Alex, had a burning desire to explore the wonders of this realm, starting from the quaint town of Valleyview and 
concluding their adventure in the bustling city of Riverside.

However, Alex had a unique twist to their journeyâ€”they wanted to visit each city exactly once, ensuring a truly immersive experience.
 As they pondered their route, Alex couldn't help but wonder: how many different paths could lead them from Valleyview to Riverside,
touching every city along the way?

2 <= n <= 20
1 <= m <= n^2
1 <= a,b <= n

-The cities are numbered 1,2,...,n.
-Then, there are m lines describing the flights.
Each line has two integers a and b: there is a flight from city a to city b. All flights are one-way flights.
