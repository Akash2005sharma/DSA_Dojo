Your task is to efficiently calculate values a^b modulo 10^9+7.
Note that in this task we assume that 0^0=1.

Input
The first input line contains an integer n: the number of calculations.
After this, there are n lines, each containing two integers a and b.
Output
Print each value a^b modulo 10^9+7.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 2*10^5
0 <= a,b <= 10^9
